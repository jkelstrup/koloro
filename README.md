## A simple Color Creator / Converter / Picker thing

I found myself opening up Photoshop just to use the color picker. That's stupid.

What I needed was a very simple color picker that supported input as HSV and RGB and returned the HEX value.

You can find it (hopefully) working at [koloro.cc](http://www.koloro.cc)

### Features
- Input a RGB value and get the HSV and HEX
- Input a HSV value and get the RGB and HEX
- Use arrow up and own to adjust your input
- Use SHIFT to adjust by 10 at a time
- The URL reflects the HEX (and can be used to input HEX as well)
- Click the HEX value to select it excluding the pound sign (to copy manually)
- Click the pound sign to select everything including the pound sign (to copy manually)
